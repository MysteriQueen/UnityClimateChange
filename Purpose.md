## Purpose
### Brief Requirements
Our task is to create an **interactive**, **believable** simulation. *Photorealism is not required.*

- Interactive: The player can interact with the simulation. *They can control, manage, and alter the progression of the simulation through actions taken by them.*
- Believable: *The simulation is realistic, from it's impacting aspects, to the effects it produces onto the world.*

Our project and report must demonstrate our **individual knowledge** of the core Virtual Reality concepts - covered in the course. This particuarly includes:

- Realism
- Believability and Usability
- Lighting
- Physics
- Animation
- Mesh Geometry

The key point is the simulation should be designed with a definite purpose in mind.

For all design points, we should keep in mind the following goals:

- Interactivity (Intuitive, Simple)
- User Experience (Immersion & Presence)
- Design (Realism vs Believability)
- Purpose (Application & Functionality)

### Our Simulation Purpose

*The key point is the simulation should be designed with a definite purpose in mind.*

Trees store a massive *reference actual amount* of carbon within them as they grow and live. They also support and provide ecosystems to thousands *again, reference* of species all over the world *again, reference*.
But their population across the globe is decreasing, due to a multitude of factors. Our simulation will implement some of these factors, alongside some of the endangered parts of our world due to deceasing forests and simulate them together allowing the player to play an interveaning role in the world.

The factors mentioned will be:

- Rising sea-levels
- Forest fires
- Droughts

The effects roughly to be viewed will be:
- Migrating animals
- Dying off animals

As the world progresses, the effects of climate change will become additional causes of climate change; resulting in a circular cause and effect situation just as in real-life *reference*.

#### Purpose (draft); the effects on forests, due to climate change
**Animals**
	
- Fox
- Bears
	- Go to river to drink
- Deer
	- Watering pond
	- hopping across river for safety from bears

**Weather**

- Droughts (lack of rain)
- Forest fires (droughts)
- Floods (rising sea-level)

**Stat System**

- Atmospheric composition
- Temperature
- Average sea level
- Eco-diversity?
	- Animals, trees in forest, and outside of forest.
- Tree population
- Forest area
- Deforestation rate (human activity)
- Forest reduction rate (all factors)
- Sea level rise rate (all factors)
- 

**Water Stuff** 

- Trees decrease -> co2 increases -> planet temperature increaeses (All shown in a stats UI) -> rain inreases -> sea levels rise -> space for trees decreases -> circle-ness

**Temperature** differentiation; ties into **sea levels**

- 

**Migrating animals**, changing **Ecosystems**, due to temperature, rising sea levels, predators moving on, prey dying off

- Less food for people

**Decreasing forests** and impacts of **Deforestation**

- Human "tribes" deforest areas for their own gain, taking up land. Statistics of the world's atmosphere changes


## Features
Terrain/map has divided; each "cell" having attributes, such as:

- Moisture
- Temperature
- Water Level (Is Water?)
- Humidity?

Survival element

- Animals? or just the player? Some very distinct "picky" animals could be implemeneted who will migrate in a minature world as time progresses.

God Character
- To change the course of the simulated world, the player is a "God" who can make changes upon the world with ease.

## Game Design
### Mechanics
Flashing red shader, for entities (forest, animals, ocean) that are being negatively impacted

### User Interface
Simulation information

- Time of day
- Temperature... average humidity, moisture... water level

Simulation Controls

- Pause, Resume, Accelerate time

## Temporary Asset Issues
- Snow texture sheet
- Rain texture sheet
- Snow sound effects (world, and sfx)
- Rain sound effects (world, and sfx)
