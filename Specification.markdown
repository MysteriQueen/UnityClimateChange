**Animals**

Fox, Bear, Deer

When an animal is taking damage, it flashes red, and takes damage. Maybe a health bar above it's head

Each animal has habitat requirements for when they rest (rest indicated by status icon above their head), i.e.:

- N number of trees in their vicinity, n number of other animals, n volume of water, n area of land

**Forest Fires**

Fire, crackling sounds

Particle system in "burning" regions of forest

**World**

***Stats***

**Simulation**
Animals wonder for food and rest. If their habitat or food source is reduced, their numbers will also reduce.

What's a habitat?
What's their food?

God-esc perspective

Pick up animals, saving them from danger or putting them in danager (simulation of animal reserves, keeping animals safe)

Planting or deforesting trees (simulation of increasing or decreasing human activity, also continues automatically through the simulation)

Picking up and dropping water (simulation of using helicopters to drop fire retardant on fires)
